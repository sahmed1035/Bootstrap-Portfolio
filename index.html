          <p>My name is Syeda Ahmed. I am a mother of a 10-year-old boy Jamal. I was born and raised in Pakistan, so I
            speak Urdu in addition to English. In my personal life, I am dedicated to my family, in particular, my son
            Jamal. I studied computer Science concentrating in Database and Data Analysis from DePaul University. Right
            after graduation, I got a job at Abbott Laboratories. After having my son, I decided to stay at home with
            him
            full-time. I love cooking, learning new recipes, and volunteering. I volunteer for STEM scout classes at my
            son's school, for example. A love for cooking runs in the family as I also support my uncle's pizza place
            by
            running the Facebook page for the business.
            Now as I see my son has grown up and needs me not as much, I am willing to pursue my career again. I have
            always been passionate about the field of technology and I am always learning something new to ensure that
            my
            skills are up-to-date. I also hold a certificate in Bio Information System.

        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>But I am not just involved with computers! Sharing knowledge and skills is very important for me.
            I have a motivational page on Facebook, “The Glass is Half Full”, followed by thousands of people. I am
            also
            working on a project called “Tutors Loop” (www.tutorsloop.net) with a team of exceptional developers. The
            platform connects students and tutors from across the world with a secure payment system. I hope soon it
            will
            provide a comfortable space for the users to continue learning whatever they want from people around the
            world.

          <p>I believe in hard work and learning, and these are values I have exemplified since the beginning of my
            career. I was among the 0.5% of top students in the U.S. for 3 years in a row and have always prided myself
            in the work I do.
            Quality matters to me in everything I do, be it programming or cooking a delicious new recipe.
