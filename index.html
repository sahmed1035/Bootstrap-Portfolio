          <p>My name is Syeda Ahmed. I was born and raised in Pakistan, so I speak Urdu in addition to English. I
            believe in hard work
            and learning, and these are values I have exemplified since the beginning of my
            career. I was among the 0.5% of outstanding students in the U.S. for 3 years in a row and have always
            prided myself in the work I do.</p>
          <p> In my personal life, I am dedicated to my family, in particular, my son. I studied computer Science
            concentrating
            in Database and Data Analysis from DePaul University. Right after graduation, I got a job at Abbott
            Laboratories. After having my son, I decided to stay at home with him full-time. I love cooking, learning
            new recipes, and volunteering. I volunteer for STEM scout classes at my son's school, for example. </p>
          <p>A love for cooking runs in the family as I also support my uncle's pizza place by running the Facebook
            page for
            the business <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mamamariapizza/" target="new">Mama Maria Pizza & More.</a>
            Now as I see my son has grown up and needs me not as much, I am willing to pursue my career again. I have
            always been passionate about the field of technology and I am always learning something new to ensure that
            my skills are up-to-date. I also hold a certificate in Bio Information System.

          <p> But I am not just involved with computers! Sharing knowledge and skills is very important for me.
            I have a motivational page on Facebook, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/theglassis" target="new">The
              Glass is Half Full</a> , followed by thousands of people. </p>
          <p> Quality matters to me in everything I do, be it programming or cooking a delicious new recipe.
            I will soon be a certified full-stack web developer from Northwestern University. I am updating myself
            with a variety of programming languages and tools in demand. </p>

          <p> I am also working on a product called <a href="https://www.tutorsloop.net/" target="new">Tutors Loop</a>
            with a team of exceptional developers.
            The platform connects students and tutors from across the world with a secure payment system. I hope soon
            it will provide a comfortable space for the users to continue learning whatever they want from people
            around the world.</p>

          <p>My professional experience includes different positions. I have worked in data management, scientific
            analysis (integrating Computer Science, Mathematics, Database programming, and Design), bioengineering,
            pharmaceuticals, and tech support. In these positions, I was able to acquire different skills, associated
            with IT, communication, development, and others.
            I would say that the greatest skill I have is adaptableness. I can easily learn new things and new
            technologies, always trying to gain new skills, and also can adapt to a variety of positions, as my work
            history indicates.
